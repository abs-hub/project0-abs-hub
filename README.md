## Tech Design and component list

* The project consists of 4 html file, one SCSS file and one custom style sheet. It uses Bootstrap 4.3.1, googleapis font Open Sans and font-awesome v 4.7 to show icons on home page and contact.html page.
* The html pages can be access from any page on the website. The social media links will redirect you to my facebook, twitter, linkedin and personal blog.
* Below is the component list and its details:
<table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th><strong>File</strong></th>
         <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td><code>index.html</code></td>
         <td>This is the home page for website, features: <br/> &bull; Unordered list navbar, leveraged using Bootstrap<br/> &bull; Full width container grid with two columns. <br/> &bull; The image borders behavior changes for small screen devices. This is done using <strong>@media</strong> query. <br/> &bull; Used SCSS inheritance and nesting on <strong>.social, .social ul, .social li</strong> <br/> &bull; Used custom stylesheets, present in main.css and has over five different CSS properties. Have used #id and .class selectors.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><code>projects.html</code></td>
         <td>This page contains the list of projects displayed using 3 column full width grid. It has 3 different images with linear-gradient background. Refer computedStyle.scss to view the colors used for gradient in $project-gradient variable</td>

      <tr>
         <td><code>certs.html</code></td>
         <td>This page shows list of Certificates and uses Bootstrap carousel to show automatic sliding effect. I have done small tweak to make the caption go below the image.

The carousel-caption heading font size is reduced to 1rem for screens up to 576px using <strong>@media</strong> query.</td>
